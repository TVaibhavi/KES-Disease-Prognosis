No specific treatment exists for hepatitis A. Your body will clear the hepatitis A virus on its own. In most cases of hepatitis A, the liver heals within six months with no lasting damage.

Hepatitis A treatment usually focuses on keeping comfortable and controlling signs and symptoms. You may need to:

1)Rest: As many people with hepatitis A infection feel tired and sick and have less energy.
2)Manage nausea: Nausea can make it difficult to eat. Try snacking throughout the day rather than eating full meals.Drinking plenty of fluids is important to prevent dehydration if vomiting occurs.
3)Avoid alcohol: Your liver may have difficulty processing medications and alcohol. If you have hepatitis, don't drink alcohol. It can cause more liver damage. 

Talk to your doctor about all the medications you take, including over-the-counter drugs.

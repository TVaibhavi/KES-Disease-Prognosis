A critical step in preventing and treating high blood pressure is a healthy lifestyle. You can lower your blood pressure with the following lifestyle changes:

1) Losing weight if you are overweight or obese
2) Quitting smoking
3) Reducing the amount of sodium in your diet 
4) Reducing stress

There are several types of drugs used to treat high blood pressure, including:

* Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
* Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)
* Diuretics
* Beta-blockers
* Calcium channel blockers

Diuretics are often recommended as the first line of therapy for most people who have high blood pressure.

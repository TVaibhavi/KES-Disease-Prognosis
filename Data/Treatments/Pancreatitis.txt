Initial treatments in the hospital may include:

1)Early eating: Newer data have suggested that eating as soon as you tolerate food helps heal the pancreas.As the inflammation in your pancreas improves and pain symptoms improve, you should begin drinking clear liquids and eating bland foods. With time, you can go back to your normal diet.

2)Pain medications: Pancreatitis can cause severe pain. Your health care team will give you medications to help control the pain.

3)Intravenous (IV) fluids. As your body devotes energy and fluids to repairing your pancreas, you may become dehydrated. For this reason, you'll receive extra fluids through a vein in your arm during your hospital stay.Once your pancreatitis is under control, your health care team will evaluate and treat the underlying cause of your pancreatitis.

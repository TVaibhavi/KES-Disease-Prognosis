When signs and symptoms are severe or the infection persists, doctors usually treat giardia infection with medications such as:

1)Metronidazole (Flagyl): Metronidazole is the most commonly used antibiotic for giardia infection. Side effects may include nausea and a metallic taste in the mouth. Don't drink alcohol while taking this medication.

2)Tinidazole (Tindamax): Tinidazole works as well as metronidazole and has many of the same side effects, but it can be given in a single dose.

3)Nitazoxanide (Alinia): Because it comes in a liquid form, nitazoxanide may be easier for children to swallow. Side effects may include nausea, gas, yellow eyes and brightly colored yellow urine.

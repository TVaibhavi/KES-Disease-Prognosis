The main treatments are:

1)antibiotics to kill the diphtheria bacteria
2)medicines that stop the effects of the harmful substances (toxins) produced by the bacteria
3)thoroughly cleaning any infected wounds if you have diphtheria affecting your skin
4)Treatment usually lasts 2 to 3 weeks. Any skin ulcers usually heal within 2 to 3 months, but may leave a scar.

People who have been in close contact with someone who has diphtheria may also need to take antibiotics, or may be given a dose of the diphtheria vaccination.

High blood pressure in men and women is a big problem. About 65 million people have high blood pressure, also known as hypertension.Typically, blood pressure increases with age. Risk of high blood pressure begins to climb when people hit age 45, although it can occur in younger people. 

People who have readings of 130/80 or higher on at least two occasions are said to have high blood pressure.

High blood pressure is usually diagnosed using the familiar blood pressure test that involves a cuff wrapped around the upper arm. The cuff is inflated and then sensors measure the pressure of blood beating against the arteries.
